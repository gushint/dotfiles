# Dotfiles + Scripts for Ubuntu

After Like 4? Ubuntu installs in a span of two weeks (please, dont ask me why), I decided I should finally A: make some scripts to install some tools I need, and B: put my dot files here, as if I didnt make the repo two years ago to do that. 

install_tools.sh is for installing some tools that I like having in an ubuntu environment. NOTE: I like installing nvim from the tarball because It is more recent than the ones on the ubuntu repo, and i had a bad experience trying to install it using the ppa. I also have some snaps (gasp) for discord, spotify and chromium because discord is is my main communication for ctf stuff on the webz, spotify because listening to music is nice, and chromium because having a second web browser is nice to have (throwback to proxy on burpsuite on a ctf). Okay time to stop rambling.

hacker_tools.sh is configuring stuff for playing ctf's. I installed GEF and configured intel syntax for disassembly.
